## 🛠️ What I Do

- **Network Security**: Building tools like network vulnerability scanners to identify open ports, vulnerabilities, and remediation strategies using C, C++, and Java.
- **Blockchain Forensics**: Developing smart contracts and forensic tools (e.g., SecureChain Forensics) for blockchain analysis, deployed on networks like Monad with MetaMask integration.
- **AI in Cybersecurity**: Creating AI-driven solutions for incident analysis, anomaly detection, and log analysis using Python, Scikit-learn, and Transformers.
- **Penetration Testing**: Designing modular programs with reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning (XSS, SQLi, LFI, etc.), and pentesting strategies, like my BountyHunter tool.
- **Automation & Bots**: Building Telegram and Discord bots to deliver real-time cybersecurity, cryptocurrency, and forex news.
- **Web Application Security**: Developing Flask- and FastAPI-based tools with hacker-style interfaces for vulnerability scanning and report generation.
- **DevSecOps**: Deploying secure applications on platforms like Render, using Docker and GitHub for seamless CI/CD pipelines.
